# Description
This project is a very dummy version of our system, where you can manually create a pay-in into an account and a payout from an account. The system allows a payout only if there is enough money in a given company’s account. This version can handle only 1 single currency.

# Tasks

1. Introduce the possibility of having multiple currency accounts in the system. Keep in mind, that we need the possibility to show in the API / UI transactions on a specific currency account.

2. Introduce the “currency exchange” function, which would make it possible to convert an amount from one currency to another. The currency exchange would need at least the following properties:
- from_currency
- to_currency
- from_amount
- to_amount
- exchange rate - this would hold the information, with which rate the customer could exchange.

Example: Sell 1000.00 CHF and Buy EUR, with an exchange_rate of “1.1”. In this example, the customer would receive 1100.00 EUR → sell_amount * exchange_rate
For the sake of this task, you can hardcode the exchange rate in a function to be always the same.

## How to test, if it works correctly

- Create a payin of 1000.00 CHF
- Create an exchange of 1000.00 CHF to 1100.00 EUR with an exchange rate of 1.1
- Create a payout of 1100.00 EUR

After all 3 transactions are executed, both the CHF and the EUR should be empty.
If you fetch the transactions on the 
- CHF account: you should see +1000.00 CHF and -1000.00 CHF (payin and exchange)
- EUR account: you should see +1100.00 EUR and - 1100.00 EUR (exchange and payout)
